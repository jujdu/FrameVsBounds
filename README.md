# FrameVsBounds

An application that can help you to understand what is frame and bounds in iOS development.

#### But wait, a liitle bit of theory:

* __Frame__ = a viewâ€™s location and size using the parent viewâ€™s coordinate system (important for placing the view in the parent).

* __Bounds__ = a viewâ€™s location and size using its own coordinate system (important for placing the viewâ€™s content or subviews within itself).

Well, what the app does? You just need to slide any slider (sorry, much of a muchness ðŸ˜†), for example X value of frame. As result you can notice how other values are changed automatically like bounds, center etc. and image with cute dogo as well. So you can figure out difference between frame and bounds. That's it.

The code was created with Objective-C for practical purposes. 

Please, feel free to use this helpful app.

If after trying the app you still don't understand what's going on, then look at [this brilliant article](https://medium.com/@suragch/frame-vs-bounds-in-ios-107990ad53ee). Thanks @Suragch.

### Good luck!
