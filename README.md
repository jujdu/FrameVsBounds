# FrameVsBounds

An application that can help you to understand what is frame and bounds in iOS development. 

#### A liitle bit of theory:

* __Frame__ = a view’s location and size using the parent view’s coordinate system (important for placing the view in the parent).

* __Bounds__ = a view’s location and size using its own coordinate system (important for placing the view’s content or subviews within itself).

The code was created with Objective-C for practical purposes. 

Please, feel free to use this helpful app.

If after trying the app you still don't understand what's going on, then look at [this brilliant article](https://medium.com/@suragch/frame-vs-bounds-in-ios-107990ad53ee). Thanks @Suragch.

Good luck!
